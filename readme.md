It allows our customers to better provide more targeted marketing to their donors and engage with donors who have churned or are likely to churn soon.

# Assignment
Using the sample data provided, implement RFM segmentation in python.

- You may decide on the data structure you would like to use for the inputs and outputs for the `rfm` function.
- You may use any packages, libraries, you'd like. 
- You may use google but please try to implement the solution on your own. I'm more interested in seeing how you think rather than you creating a perfect solution.


# Further questions
- What additional insights could we draw from the rfm data.
- How would we implement this solution in production?
